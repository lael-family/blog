title: "God's Righteous Judgement"
slug: gods-righteous-judgement

In **Luke 24:46-47**, **Acts 2:38**, and **Acts 10:43**, Jesus tells us what the Gospel is about. Jesus Christ had to suffer, and to rise from the dead on the third day. As a result, in His name, all who believe will receive the remission (forgiveness) of sins and receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

The questions we will answer in this letter include:

* How can a righteous God make a sinful man righteous?
    
* How can God live inside of me?
    
* Is God’s judgement for everyone?
    
* What happens when I accept God’s testimony?
    
* What happens when I reject God’s testimony?
